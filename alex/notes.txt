    - Illustrates fundamentals of a generative model for timeseries. Use a generative model. For every point x[ti] in the past, train the generative model with what preceded ti as the Inputs and what folled ti as the Desired outcome. 
    Run model to predict x[t+s] from x[t]
    
Linear Sytems ie Digital Signal Processing theory is used to convert your timeseriees into a frequency and use these methods to predcit future prices
